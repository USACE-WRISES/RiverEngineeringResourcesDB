Reestablishing equilibrium between the sediment supply and available transport capacity in the restored reach is the primary objective of the design framework. A geomorphic engineering approach is presented, which recognizes that the river is ultimately the best restorer of its natural morphology and should be allowed to participate in its own recovery. This is accomplished through designing an approximate channel mould, based on the broad dimensions of the river, and then allowing the river itself to develop the intricate cross-sectional detail and intra-reach morphological features to complete the recovery process. Geomorphic engineering provides a practical solution by striking a balance between empirical-statistical and analytical process-based methods.","USACE ERDC","erdc-library.erdc.dren.mil","Documents_Knowledge Base_Hydrology,Documents_Knowledge Base_Hydraulics,Documents_Knowledge Base_Geomorphology,Documents_Evaluation_Hydrology,Documents_Evaluation_Hydraulics,Documents_Evaluation_Sediment Transport,Documents_Evaluation_Geomorphology,Documents_Design Theory_Hydraulic Geometry,Documents_Design Theory_Stable ch design and Stabilization,Documents_Design Theory_Threshold channel design,Documents_Design Theory_Alluvial Channel Design,Documents_Design Theory_Analytical Design,Documents_Actions and Goals_In stream Structures"

To be considered stable, a structure must be able to resist hydraulic forces with an appropriate factor of safety. The design practitioner is typically forced to perform numerous complex and time-consuming calculations to achieve the desired level of safety, resulting in additional project time and expense. To assist these practitioners, an Excel spreadsheet tool was developed that applies computational equations and design guidelines to analyze virtually any proposed configuration of small-to-medium size structures.","USFS","fs.fed.us","Models and Tools_Hydraulics_Hydraulic parameters,Models and Tools_Geomorphology_Geomorphic Features,Models and Tools_Actions and Goals_Instream Structures,Models and Tools_Actions and Goals_Large Wood"
