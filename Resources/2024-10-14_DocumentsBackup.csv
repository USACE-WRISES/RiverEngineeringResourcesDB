Reestablishing equilibrium between the sediment supply and available transport capacity in the restored reach is the primary objective of the design framework. A geomorphic engineering approach is presented, which recognizes that the river is ultimately the best restorer of its natural morphology and should be allowed to participate in its own recovery. This is accomplished through designing an approximate channel mould, based on the broad dimensions of the river, and then allowing the river itself to develop the intricate cross-sectional detail and intra-reach morphological features to complete the recovery process. Geomorphic engineering provides a practical solution by striking a balance between empirical-statistical and analytical process-based methods.",USACE ERDC,erdc-library.erdc.dren.mil,X,X,X,X,-,-,-,X,X,X,X,-,-,X,-,X,X,X,X,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,X
